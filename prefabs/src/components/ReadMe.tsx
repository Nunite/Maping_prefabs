export const readMeText = `HOW TO USE:
clicking a button will copy that brush or entity to your clipboard

You should have both prototype_1_3.wad and makkon_trim_guide.wad loaded to avoid UV corruption;
OR
ctrl+alt+v, apply a new texture, ctrl+x, ctrl+v

in trenchbroom, when you hit ctrl+z (undo) on a prefab you pasted in, it will not undo the paste â€” instead it reverts the translation from its original position to its new position. so you should delete brushes you pasted in instead of hitting undo

technical note:
brushes that need to be unique (such as linked groups; ex: "radial") will have their trenchbroom linked ID set to Date.now() (milliseconds since unix epoch)`

			}}
			onClick={() => setToggle(!toggled())}

			{readMeText}
